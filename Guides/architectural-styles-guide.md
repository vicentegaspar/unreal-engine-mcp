# üèõÔ∏è Architectural Styles Guide

## Overview

The Unreal Engine MCP now supports rich architectural styles that can be applied to buildings, towns, and castles. These styles provide detailed descriptive text that enhances the visual and thematic appearance of your constructed worlds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Using Architectural Styles

### Available MCP Tools

#### `list_architectural_styles()`
Lists all available styles with complete descriptions and metadata.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "styles": {...},
  "style_count": 12,
  "summary": "Available Architectural Styles:\n\n‚Ä¢ Ruins: The structures are old and eroded..."
}
```

#### `get_architectural_style_info(style_name)`
Get detailed information about a specific style.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "style": {
    "name": "Elven",
    "description": "The structures are of elven architecture...",
    "materials": ["living wood", "crystal", "silver accents"],
    "features": ["curved roofs", "flowing lines", "tall spires"],
    "colors": ["forest green", "silver", "natural wood"]
  }
}
```

#### `enhance_building_prompt(base_prompt, architectural_style, additional_details)`
Enhance a building prompt with style descriptions.

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "original_prompt": "Build a castle",
  "enhanced_prompt": "Build a castle\n\nArchitectural Style: Corrupted\n...",
  "style_used": "corrupted",
  "style_description": "The structures are spiky and malformed..."
}
```

### Enhanced Building Functions

All major building functions now support the `architectural_style` or `thematic_style` parameter:

#### Houses
```python
construct_house(
    width=1200,
    depth=1000,
    height=600,
    location=[0, 0, 0],
    name_prefix="MyHouse",
    house_style="modern",
    architectural_style="elven"  # NEW: Thematic style
)
```

#### Towns
```python
create_town(
    town_size="medium",
    building_density=0.7,
    location=[0, 0, 0],
    architectural_style="mixed",  # Legacy building types
    thematic_style="ruins"  # NEW: Overall thematic style
)
```

#### Castles
```python
create_castle_fortress(
    castle_size="large",
    location=[0, 0, 0],
    architectural_style="medieval",  # Legacy castle style
    thematic_style="corrupted"  # NEW: Thematic overlay
)
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Creating a Ruined Town
```python
# Create a town with ruins theme
create_town(
    town_size="medium",
    building_density=0.5,  # Lower density for ruins
    location=[0, 0, 0],
    name_prefix="AncientRuins",
    thematic_style="ruins"
)
```

### Building an Elven House
```python
# Create an elven-style house
construct_house(
    width=1000,
    depth=800,
    height=500,
    location=[0, 0, 0],
    name_prefix="ElvenDwelling",
    house_style="cottage",
    architectural_style="elven"
)
```

### Corrupted Castle Fortress
```python
# Create a dark, corrupted castle
create_castle_fortress(
    castle_size="large",
    location=[0, 0, 0],
    name_prefix="DarkFortress",
    architectural_style="gothic",
    thematic_style="corrupted"
)
```

### Enhanced Prompt Example
```python
# Enhance a building prompt with style
enhance_building_prompt(
    base_prompt="Create a mystical tower reaching toward the sky",
    architectural_style="crystalline",
    additional_details="Add rainbow light effects and floating crystal formations"
)
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Style Consistency**: Use the same thematic style across related buildings for cohesive environments
2. **Density Adjustment**: Lower building density for "ruins" and "destroyed" styles to show abandonment
3. **Size Scaling**: Larger structures work better with dramatic styles like "celestial" or "volcanic"
4. **Prompt Enhancement**: Use `enhance_building_prompt()` to generate rich descriptions for complex builds
5. **Combination Styles**: Mix legacy building styles with thematic styles for layered effects

## üîß Implementation Details

### Style Information Structure
```json
{
  "name": "Style Name",
  "description": "Detailed description of the architectural style",
  "materials": ["material1", "material2", "material3"],
  "features": ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"],
  "colors": ["color1", "color2", "color3"]
}
```

### Return Value Enhancement
All building functions now return additional style information when a thematic style is applied:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "actors": [...],
  "architectural_style": {
    "name": "Elven",
    "description": "The structures are of elven architecture...",
    "materials": [...],
    "features": [...],
    "colors": [...]
  },
  "style_description": "The structures are of elven architecture..."
}
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Material Color Integration**: Automatic color application based on style palettes
- **Structural Modifications**: Physical alterations to match style descriptions
- **Style Mixing**: Combine multiple styles for unique hybrids
- **Dynamic Style Evolution**: Buildings that change styles over time
- **Custom Style Definitions**: User-defined architectural styles
